for SA:MP v0.3.7

Features:
- save, load, delete locations
- teleport by clicking on map
- noclip like airbrake (settings for speed)

other stuff:
- saves settings into config file (locations, airbrake speed)
- basic speedometer
- invicibility
- infinite ammo
- some statistics (teleportation count, time spent using airbrake)

controls for airbrake:
- w,a,s,d,space,lctrl,lshift,x


known bugs:
- lots
- if the ini file isnt present and you start SAMPTeleporter.exe it will display an error. restart for it to work normally after that. i think this only happens when GTA:SA:MP is already running
